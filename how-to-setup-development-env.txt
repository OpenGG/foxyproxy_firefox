How to setup a FoxyProxy development environment in Firefox on Windows/Unix/Linux:

For build instructions, see how-to-build.txt

1. Modify the way Firefox is started so it includes these command-line arguments:
     -console -profileManager
     e.g.: "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -console -profileManager -purgecaches -no-remote
     or
     /usr/local/bin/firefox -console -profileManager -purgecaches -no-remote

   Now whenever you start Firefox, you can see stdout and stderr in the console.
   This is important because all dump() statements in FoxyProxy
   write to stdout. The -profileManager argument allows you to create/delete
   profiles which you'll need for step 2.

2. Start FF and create a new profile.

3. Enable all debugging preferences mentioned here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Setting_up_extension_development_environment. Alternatively, use https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/devprefs/ or https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/developer-profile/

4. Close FF.

5. Find the new profile on your hard drive. Go to its extensions\ directory;
   e.g., C:\Documents and Settings\EricJung\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\
            Profiles\g1jro8hx.dev\extensions
   and create a file named foxyproxy@eric.h.jung
   It should contain a single line that is the path to the src directory you checked
   out from FoxyProxy's git repository. e.g.:
     <drive>:\dev\foxyproxy\trunk\src
     or
     ~/foxyproxy/trunk/src
   
6. Start FF. You should be able to access FoxyProxy. Any change you
   make to non-overlay code in the src/ directory takes effect immediately.
   However, you must close and re-open dialogs for dialog-included JS and XUL
   changes to be visible (e.g., options.xul). If you make changes to overlay code,
   you must restart FF for the changes to take effect.

7. Use dump() statements to output stuff to stdout; console() statements to
   write to the console.
