How to build foxyproxy-x.x.xpi on Windows/Unix/Linux:

This project uses ant (http://ant.apache.org) to build its targets.
Ant is a free, open-source, cross-platform java tool. No IDE is
necessary but if you want to use Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org),
an Eclipse .project file is included.

You can either download ant from
http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi or download and install Eclipse.
If you choose ant instead of Eclipse, ensure you also download a Java
Development Environment (JDK) and set appropriate ant environment
variables. Specifically, you might consider adding the ant script to your
PATH variable and exporting the ANT_HOME environment variable. If you use
Eclipse IDE, you neither have to download the JDK nor setup ant environment
variables.

You also need ant-optional JARs. For debian-based linux distributions,
see http://packages.debian.org/lenny/ant-optional. Alternatively, just add
ant-nodeps.jar to your CLASSPATH environment vairable.

The ant build script is src/build.xml. The default target, named "build",
builds the XPI in the directory ../targets.
If you want to change this directory, change the value of the target-path
property.Note that forward slashes are platform-independent in ant scripts;
they work on both windows and *nix -- providing you have appropriate
permissions on them.
