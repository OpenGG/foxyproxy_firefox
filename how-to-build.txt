How to build foxyproxy-x.x.xpi on Windows/Unix/Linux:

For instruction on setting up a development environment, see

This project uses ant (http://ant.apache.org) to build its targets.
Ant is a free, open-source, cross-platform java tool. No IDE is
necessary, but if you want to use Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org),
an Eclipse .project file is included.

You can either download ant
from http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi or download and install
Eclipse. If you choose ant instead of Eclipse, ensure you also download
a Java Development Environment (JDK) and set appropriate ant environment
variables. Specifically, you might consider adding the ant script to your
PATH variable and exporting the ANT_HOME environment variable. If you use
Eclipse IDE, you neither have to download the JDK nor setup ant environment
variables.

The ant build script is src/build.xml. The default target, named "build",
builds the XPI in the directory /dev/foxyproxy/standard/fx+flock/trunk/src.
If you want to change this directory, change the value of the src-base
property. You might also want to change the value of the temporary directory
which is /tmp/fp-temp and is stored in the variable temp-path. Note that
forward slashes are platform-independent in ant scripts; they work on both
windows and *nix -- providing the directories exist and you have appropriate
permissions on them.
