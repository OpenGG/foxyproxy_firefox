* Removed hyperlink around Jesper Hansen's name in the About window since his website appears to be gone
* Fix for windows tools menu indent problem - thanks Nils Maier!
* Changing statusbar info default. Previously, the statusbar by default displayed "FoxyProxy: <mode>"
  then the FoxyProxy icon. Since, color-per-proxy was introduced, it doesn't make much sense to
  keep "FoxyProxy: <mode>" there by default. Mode can be inferred from the icon color. Moreover,
  many addons are trying to minimize their statusbar footprint these days. It makes sense to
  remove this default option. You can restore it by clicking Ctrl+F2 then Global Settings tab->
  Indicators->Show mode (text) on statusbar. This does not affect upgraded installations; only new
  installations.
* Changed references of foxyproxy.mozdev.org to getfoxyproxy.org
* Improved support for Firefox 4 beta. Known bug: context-menus are translucent on Windows.
