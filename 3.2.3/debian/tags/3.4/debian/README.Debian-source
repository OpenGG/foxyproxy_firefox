README on source packaging of foxyproxy:
----------------------------------------

Versions up to 2.8 were wrapped for Debian using dh_wraporig
script. Versions 2.13 up to 3.2 used Debian packaging directly in a git
repository. Since version 3.2 there is no Debian packaging repository
available. Debian packaging is currently getting rebuilt in the upstream SVN
repository.
