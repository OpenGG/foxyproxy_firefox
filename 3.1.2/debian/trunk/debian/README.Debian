Some notes:

Package was named as foxyproxy (as opposed to mozilla-foxyproxy, which
used to be a common naming practice) since mozilla is a trademark we
are not really allowed to use. So, to avoid future renaming of the
package, and since debtags can be very helpful in filtering out
similar packages of interest (i.e. extensions for iceweasel), I
decided to stay with foxyproxy.
