* New, better colorpicker for selecting color-per-proxy -- Thanks, Jesper Hansen!
* Color now displayed in FoxyProxy Options dialog as requested here: http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/drupal/content/color-icon-status-bar#comment-2849
* Narrowed CSS specificity for FoxyProxy's tree styling to prevent interference with
    addons such as FindInTabs (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8078).  This also fixes the long-standing
    bug in some Firefox versions whereby the Firefox addressbar/awesomebar shows blank lines when autosuggesting websites.
* Removed useless "mode" column in options dialog tree view
* New proxy names default to host/ip address (if one was entered), otherwise they default back to the original "New Proxy" name. Requested here:

* Tooltips for proxies, when listed in any menu, show the proxy notes field (used to replicate the proxy name). Requested here:

* better debugging for failed proxy filtering (as requested somewhere in the forums)
* differentiation between FoxyProxy Basic and FoxyProxy Plus in labels within the application. Previously, such labels just said "FoxyProxy" instead of "FoxyProxy Basic" or "FoxyProxy Standard". This makes it clearer to the user which edition he's using, hopefully making support easier.
* Support for closing FoxyProxy dialogs/windows on OS/X with Command-W
* removed a dump() statement
* better socks dns handling; still needs work
* icons for buttons and tabs
* Conditional builds for FoxyProxy Basic 
* locale updates
* removed id-ID and mk-MK locales since they've been empty for ages
