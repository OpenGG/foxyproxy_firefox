2.9.1
=====
* Fixed the huge width of the AddEditProxy dialog so it's not so huge
* Changed all the donate/buy buttons and links
* Added jesper to the about box
* When adding a new proxy, the Proxy Details tab is now the default tab. This contributes towards faster addition of new proxies (one less click)
* Warning message for "You didn't enter and enable any whitelisted (inclusive) URL patterns ..." now has a "Do not show this message again" checkbox
  for better usability to people who use FoxyProxy like SwitchProxy (i.e., load all URLs through one proxy at a time)
* Revamp of "Do not show this message again" checkboxes so they can more easily be added for all sorts of annoying, recurring questions in FoxyProxy. As
  a side-effect, your previous selections for the two existing "Do not show this message again" checkboxes are reset after upgrading to this version. One
  of these is "The pattern has no wildcard characters ..." and the other is only for Thunderbird users ("You have chosen a non-SOCKS proxy. POP3, IMAP, and all
  other email protocols must use SOCKS proxies; they cannot use HTTP proxies. Continue anyway?")
  
* Fixed longstanding bug whereby regular expression special characters ($, ., +, (, ), and ^) couldn't be used in URL patterns
* Ability to disable resetting of icon colors after URLs have finished loading. Change the new attribute /foxyproxy[@resetIconColors] from true to false.
  This enables you to easily see which proxy was last used (instead of having to use the FoxyProxy Logging tab). Note there is no
  GUI for this setting
