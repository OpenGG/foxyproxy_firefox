FoxyProxy Standard 2.17 and FoxyProxy Basic 1.3
===============================================

* DNS lookups now fixed! Removed the Global Setting "Use SOCKS proxy for DNS lookups" and replaced it with
  a "Use this proxy for all DNS lookups" checkbox on each Proxy Settings dialog. However, only one proxy can be
  chosen amongst all proxies. See screenshot here: and here:
* Fixed "Cycle Through Modes" bug as described here: http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/drupal/content/cycle-through-modes-issue
* Logging tab: moved "Open URL in New Tab", "Copy URL to Clipboard", and "Delete Selection" buttons above the log so the horizontal
  view of the log is maximized. Requested here: 
* Added proxy color to the logging tab
* Fixed text-wrapping when resizing the "Choose Proxy" dialog (initiated from the Alt+F3 "QuickProxy" shortcut)
* Proxy color now displayed when pressing the Alt+F3 "QuickProxy" shortcut
