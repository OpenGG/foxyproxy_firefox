* DNS "leak" fix for SOCKS proxies. See the new checkbox in Proxy Settings: "Perform remote DNS lookups
  on hostnames loading through this proxy". This checkbox is now checked by default for new SOCKS proxies.
* Menu colors (statusbar, toolbar, context-menu) now match customized proxy color
* Minor Add/Edit Proxy dialog bug fix
* Animated FoxyProxy icon in About box (Thanks, Jesper!)
* Work towards: if PAC is disabled due to the PAC not found, it will be automatically restored
  when the PAC file is next found
* McAfee Site Advisor support (http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/drupal/content/foxyproxy-latest-mcafee-site-advisor)
* Work towards http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/drupal/content/one-my-proxies-being-disabled but feature is not yet complete.
* Width and height of main options dialog and proxy settings dialog remembered between opening/closing
* Fixed bug which prevented the proper display of an error message to the user if he was using a PAC with a syntax error or other problems.
  Discussed here: http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/drupal/content/seems-be-bug-using-pac-files-thisnotifyuseroferrors
* Proxy DNS column added to Proxies list in the main window and ChooseProxy window (displayed with Alt+F3)
* Default display columns for new installations is now:
    Proxy list:
       Enabled
       Color
       Proxy Name
       Proxy Notes
    
    URLS Patterns list:
       Enabled
       Pattern Name
       URL pattern
       Whitelist/Blacklist
    
    Logging list:
       Timestamp
       Color
       Proxy Name   
       URL
       Pattern Name
  All other columns are still available but must be enabled explictly. The point is to enable less clutter
  by hiding by default lesser-important columns.
* Tor wizard now uses remote DNS lookup by default instead of prompting the user
