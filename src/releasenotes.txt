* Menu colors (statusbar, toolbar, context-menu) now match customized proxy color
* DNS SOCKS leak fix
* addeditproxy.xul bug fix
* rotating foxyproxy icon in About box (Thanks, Jesper!)
* Work towards: if PAC is disabled due to the PAC not found, it will be automatically restored
  when the PAC file is next found
* McAfee Site Advisor support (http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/drupal/content/foxyproxy-latest-mcafee-site-advisor)
* Added a hidden setting (i.e., no GUI currently) which, when set, prevents the default behavior of proxy disabling when its PAC file is bad.
  A "bad" PAC file is one that can't be loaded (perhaps it's not available on the current network connection) or can't be parsed successfully.
  In the case of the Default proxy loading a bad PAC file, the default behavior is to switch it to DIRECT (i.e., no proxy and no PAC file).
  This behavior, too, is prevented with the same hidden setting. To use the setting, close Firefox. Open foxyproxy.xml (the FAQ explains
  how to find this file). Change instances of the XML attribute /foxyproxy/proxies/proxy[@disableOnBadPAC] on the proxies whose behavior you
  want changed. The default value is true; change it to false to override the default behavior. Feature requested by Tony here:
  http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/drupal/content/one-my-proxies-being-disabled.

* TODO: put loadDefaultPAC() from foxyproxy.js back (well, its functionality anyway)
        finish and/or more testing for auto re-enable of PAC if it's disabled due to PAC not found
