* fixed UI sluggishness due to import of large amount of patterns
* fixed bugs in Regular Expressions for no localhost pattern feature (see:
  http://forums.getfoxyproxy.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=148)
* the "no localhost patterns" are now properly removed if the pattern tree gets
  sorted
* fixed regression (the localhost pattern checkbox was always checked after
  Firefox startup)
* improved parsing of AutoProxy patterns
* add pattern itself as name to a created pattern if its name is missing
