* DNS "leak" fix for SOCKS proxies. See the new checkbox in Proxy Settings: "Perform remote DNS lookups
  on hostnames loading through this proxy". This checkbox is now checked by default for new SOCKS proxies.
* Menu colors (statusbar, toolbar, context-menu) now match customized proxy color
* Minor Add/Edit Proxy dialog bug fix
* Animated FoxyProxy icon in About box (Thanks, Jesper!)
* Work towards: if PAC is disabled due to the PAC not found, it will be automatically restored
  when the PAC file is next found
* McAfee Site Advisor support (http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/drupal/content/foxyproxy-latest-mcafee-site-advisor)
* Added a hidden setting (i.e., no GUI currently) which, when set, prevents the default behavior of proxy disabling when its PAC file is bad.
  A "bad" PAC file is one that can't be loaded (perhaps it's not available on the current network connection) or can't be parsed successfully.
  In the case of the Default proxy loading a bad PAC file, the default behavior is to switch it to DIRECT (i.e., no proxy and no PAC file).
  This behavior, too, is prevented with the same hidden setting. To use the setting, close Firefox. Open foxyproxy.xml (the FAQ explains
  how to find this file). Change instances of the XML attribute /foxyproxy/proxies/proxy[@disableOnBadPAC] on the proxies whose behavior you
  want changed. The default value is true; change it to false to override the default behavior. Feature requested by Tony here:
  http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/drupal/content/one-my-proxies-being-disabled.
* Width and height of main options dialog and proxy settings dialog remembered between opening/closing
* Fixed bug which prevented the proper display of an error message to the user if he was using a PAC with a syntax error or other problems.

* Proxy DNS column added to Proxies list in the main window and ChooseProxy window (displayed with Alt+F3)
* Default display columns for new installations is now:
    Proxy list:
       Enabled
       Color
       Proxy Name
       Proxy Notes
    
    URLS Patterns list:
       Enabled
       Pattern Name
       URL pattern
       Whitelist/Blacklist
    
    Logging list:
       Timestamp
       Color
       Proxy Name   
       URL
       Pattern Name
  All other columns are still available but must be enabled explictly. The point is to enable less clutter
  by hiding by default lesser-important columns.
* Tor wizard now uses remote DNS lookup by default instead of prompting the user
