This package was Debianized by Yaroslav Halchenko
<debian@onerussian.com> on  Mon, 11 Dec 2006 21:48:12 -0500

Originally .xpi file downloaded from
 https://addons.mozilla.org/addon.php?id=2464 and is wrapped inside
.tar.gz using dh_wraporig script, which allows automatic 'upgrades'.
Since .xpi sources had all formatting removed, they could not be
considered "original source" in terms of GPLv2 license.
In july 2007 Eric made sources available from public SVN repository,
and since then foxyproxy became available in Debian.
See README.Debian-source for more information about sources of
foxyproxy available within Debian.
